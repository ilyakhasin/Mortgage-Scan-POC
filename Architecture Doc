Architectural Document

**Project Name:** MortgageData-PoC 2026  
**Primary Goal:** To validate the feasibility of mobile-based mortgage document extraction using off-the-shelf IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) solutions.


#### A. System Components
1.  **Capture Layer (Client-Side):** Uses **Veryfi Lens SDK** for React Native. This component provides the native camera interface, handling image quality checks (blur/lighting) and auto-cropping locally to ensure optimal OCR results.
2.  **Extraction Layer (Cloud AI):** Captured images are sent via an encrypted HTTPS request to the **Veryfi Bank Statement API**. The API returns a JSON object containing structured mortgage fields.
3.  **State Management:** React **Context API** or **Zustand** manages the "Extracted Data State" across the scanning and form-filling screens.
4.  **UI/UX Layer:** Built with **Tailwind CSS (NativeWind)** for a responsive, modern form interface that allows users to override AI-extracted values.

#### B. Data Flow
1.  **Trigger:** User initiates scan; `VeryfiLens.showCamera()` is called.
2.  **Capture:** The SDK captures the image and returns a base64 or file path.
3.  **Processing:** The app sends the payload to the extraction endpoint.
4.  **Mapping:** The JSON response is mapped to the React Native form state:
    *   `total_amount` → `loan_balance`
    *   `vendor_address` → `property_address`
    *   `due_date` → `next_payment_date`
5.  **Review:** User modifies data in the form and saves it to a local SQLite/WatermelonDB instance.

#### C. Performance & Security (2026 Standards)
*   **Architecture:** Implemented with **TurboModules** for zero-copy frame processing, ensuring the camera UI runs at a consistent 60 FPS.

*   **Privacy:** All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3. No raw document images are stored on the device post-processing unless the user opts into a "local vault" feature.
